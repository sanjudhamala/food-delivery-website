1. Responsive web design:
Website will respond to/work well any device of any screen size.

3 main principles of Responsive Web Desing:
1. Fluid Grid: All layouts are sized with relative units such as percentages instead of fixed units such as pixels
2. Flexible Images: All images are also sized with relative units
3. Media Queries: Are written to style the website differently for each device/screen-size.
